|T1| Select and transport drawer(s) to database station.|||
|T2|Select specimen for data entry.|||
|T3|Space labels on pin to make the data visible or remove label(s) from pins and arrange in pin order, top to bottom to facilitate label re-insertion.|Train data technicians on particular label characteristics peculiar to the collection, including peculiarities of handwriting or frequent occurrence of cryptic notations made by major collectors represented in the collection. For re-inserting pins into labels, turn label upside-down and flatten original hole with broad end of forceps, this allows the same hole to be reused and the label to be secure.|Find links to instructions and label forceps @mandrewj |
