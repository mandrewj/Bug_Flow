# M. Andrew Johnston Research Collection

The M. Andrew Johnston Research Collection (coden: MAJC) is currently housed at (but not integrated within) Arizona State University Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center (BioKIC). This collection contains primarily specimens of darkling beetles (family Tenebrionidae Latrielle, 1802), with an emphasis on taxa from the southwestern deserts of North America.

## This page is useless
I just added it to have content.  I can upload label templates and other things

## Serial Label Template
The file is available in this directory. [Download Here](./MAJC-Serial-Labels.xls)

To use this template, change the starting number in the cell A2 (first label) and the rest of the labels will automatically update to auto increment by 1 and add leading zeros.  This file prints 525 labels on a single page.
